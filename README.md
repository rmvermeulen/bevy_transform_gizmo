# Bevy Transform Gizmo

**Simple 3D transform gizmo for bevy**

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fec4e20-9068-4821-a967-72d07562777d>

</div>

# Demo

Run a minimal implementation of the gizmo by cloning this repository and running:

```shell
cargo run --example minimal
```

# Features

- Prebuilt transform gizmo appears when you select a designated mesh
- Translation handles (axis, plane, and normal to camera)
- Rotation handles
- Gizmo always renders on top of the main render pass
- Gizmo is always the same size at it moves closer/further from the camera
- **New in this Fork:** Gizmo rotates with the Object

# Usage

See the [minimal](examples/minimal.rs) demo for an example of a minimal implementation.
